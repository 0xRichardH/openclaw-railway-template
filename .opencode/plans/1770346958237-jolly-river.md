# Plan: Add GitHub CLI (gh) to Docker Image

## Problem

The GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed in the Docker container. Attempting to install it at runtime using `brew install gh` fails because:

1. The container runs as `root`
2. Homebrew is installed under the `linuxbrew` user and doesn't work as root
3. The Homebrew installation has no git remote configured (it's a minimal install)

## Solution

Add `gh` to the existing Homebrew install step in the Dockerfile, which runs as the `linuxbrew` user during build time.

## Files to Modify

- `/home/richard/0xdev/code/clawdbot-railway-template/Dockerfile` (lines 91-99)

## Changes

Update the `brew install` command to include `gh`:

```dockerfile
# Install common dev tools via Homebrew (as linuxbrew user)
RUN brew install \
    wget \
    jq \
    yq \
    ripgrep \
    fd \
    fzf \
    gh \
  && brew cleanup \
  && brew --version
```

## Verification

After rebuilding the image:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t clawdbot-railway .

# Run container and verify gh is available
docker run --rm clawdbot-railway gh --version
```

Expected output: `gh version X.X.X`
